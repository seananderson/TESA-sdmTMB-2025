# Data integration

Employing multiple data sources in the same population, stock assessment, or species distribution model.

--

Also known as "data fusion" or "integrated analysis".

--

Different data sources could be 
.small[
- multiple surveys of the same kind
- surveys with different gear
- commercial CPUE
- different data "types" (e.g., presence-absence with count data)
]

# Types of data integration

Spatial domain: same domain vs. "expanded domain"

Catchability: equal, constant difference, spatially varying

Any combination of these!

With (or sometimes without) comparative fishing

]

---

# Expanded domain

Examples:

Two surveys or more bienniel surveys run by one agency together covering a coastline (e.g., BC groundfish surveys)

Two or more surveys run by neighbouring agencies with somewhat different gear but enough spatiotemporal proximity

# Why data integration?

# Why data integration?

.small[
Model a species over a larger range (e.g., for transboundry distribution shift metrics, better estimates of environmental covariates of distribution)
]

--

.small[
Can make use of available data with often more accurate and precise distribution predictions
]

--

.small[
For single synthetic population indices:
- Assessment models aren't usually equipped to combine spatial data
- Often statistically convenient
- Sometimes necessary when designing management procedures
- Fish Stocks provisions "one stock, one LRP" guidance
]

# How do we do data integration?

---

# Regression discontinuity design (RDD)

The ability to integrate data, especially in an expanded domain context depends on the concept of regression discontinuity design.

```{r, out.width="70%"}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(123)
n <- 200
running <- seq(1400, 2800, length.out = n)
cutoff <- 2000
treatment <- ifelse(running >= cutoff, 1, 0)

# Simulate outcomes with different intercepts/slopes on each side
outcome <- 1000 + 0.9 * running + 300 * treatment + rnorm(n, 0, 100)

# Combine into a data frame
df <- data.frame(running, outcome, treatment = factor(treatment))

# Fit regressions on each side of the cutoff
fit0 <- lm(outcome ~ running, data = df[df$running < cutoff, ])
fit1 <- lm(outcome ~ running, data = df[df$running >= cutoff, ])

# Predict fitted lines for plotting
pred0 <- data.frame(running = seq(min(df$running), cutoff, length.out = 100))
pred1 <- data.frame(running = seq(cutoff, max(df$running), length.out = 100))
pred0$fit <- predict(fit0, newdata = pred0)
pred1$fit <- predict(fit1, newdata = pred1)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = running, y = outcome, color = treatment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(data = pred0, aes(y = fit), color = "black") +
  geom_line(data = pred1, aes(y = fit), color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = cutoff, color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "Covariate value",
    y = "Outcome"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

---

# Ways of accounting for catchability

Constant catchability coefficient

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
formula = catch ~ factor(year) + 
  factor(gear) #<<
```

Spatially varying catchability coefficient

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
formula = catch ~ factor(year) + 
  factor(gear), #<<
spatial_varying = ~ factor(gear) #<<
```

Mind what your base gear factor level is

---

# Different likelihoods

Data integration can be with the same or different likelihoods.

Examples:

**Same**: two surveys that collect catch weight (e.g., delta-Gamma or Tweedie)

**Different**: catch count (Poisson) + presence-absence (Bernoulli with clogog link)

---

# Combining all continuous positive, count, and 0-1 data (😲)

.small[
Idea: there's an underlying surface of fish population intensity. You observe it as one of:<br>- weight, count, presence/absence
]

.small[
Internally, share linear predictors, convert into different observation likelihoods.
]

--

.small[
Key concepts:
- a cloglog linked Bernoulli can be thought of as a "thinned" observation of a count process
- a Poisson-link delta model has an underlying "count" model and a weight per "count"
]

# Food for thought on data integration

# Deciding whether you should combine data

.small[
Do they represent the same population?
]

--

.small[
Are the selectivities similar enough, if you're not controlling for it?
]

--

.small[
Do the datasets give a similar impression on their own?
]

--

.small[
Does it help or hinder your stock assessment to create an integrated index?
]

--

.small[
Does a secondary data source substantially change parameter estimates from those of a trusted data source? ([Rufener et al. 2021 Ecol. Appl.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2453)).
]

# Caveats

Unless fish length interacts with catchability, you're assuming matching length selectivity

--

Expanded domain models can go awry in practice!

--

There may be good reasons to not integrate two datasets

--

This is pretty new in the fisheries world

--

Using different likelihoods per row of data isn't merged into the main branch of sdmTMB yet, but should be soon. It's possible in tinyVAST.
